This sketech creates a volume control knob from a rotary encoder to work
with a computer. The sketch has been tested on an Arduino Leonardo clone
named the LeoStick, from Freetronics.

The sketch is known to work on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and Mac OS/X 10.7.5. The 
volume up down functions, but not the mute function, have been tested to
work on a Nexus 7 tablet running KitKat (4.4.2) using a USB-OTG cable.

This sketch is based on the work of Digistump Digispark forum poster Bluebie,
for the initial sketch and wiring diagram.
A prerequisite for this sketch is making the modifications detailed on the
blog post of Stefan Jones:
